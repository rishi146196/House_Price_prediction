# House Price Prediction with Machine Learning

This repository focuses on predicting house prices by leveraging several machine learning algorithms. The project walks through essential stages such as data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation, providing an in-depth analysis of each method’s performance.

## Project Goals

The primary goal of this project is to build and compare the performance of various machine learning models in predicting house prices. It aims to identify the model that best generalizes the data by exploring different approaches and optimizing their performance.

## Key Highlights

- *Data Preprocessing*: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features to prepare data for machine learning models.
- *Exploratory Data Analysis*: Visualizing data distributions, correlations, and feature importance to gain insight into the underlying trends.
- *Machine Learning Algorithms*:
  - Multiple Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Gradient Boosting (GBM)
  - XGBoost
- *Performance Evaluation*: Assessment of model performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R², along with cross-validation.
- *Model Optimization*: Employing grid search for hyperparameter tuning to maximize model accuracy and reduce overfitting.

## Dataset

The dataset contains detailed information about houses, including features like the number of bedrooms, square footage, and location. You can download it [here](insert_link_to_dataset).

3. Install the dependencies:
   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

## Running the Notebook

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   bash
   jupyter notebook House_Price.ipynb
   

2. The notebook contains code to:
   - Load the dataset and preprocess the data
   - Perform exploratory data analysis
   - Train and test multiple machine learning models
   - Evaluate model performance using various metrics
   - Fine-tune models through hyperparameter optimization

## Machine Learning Models in Focus

- *Linear Regression*: A foundational model to establish a benchmark for performance.
- *Decision Trees & Random Forest*: These tree-based models capture non-linear relationships in the data and work well with minimal preprocessing.
- *Support Vector Machines (SVM)*: A powerful algorithm that works well with high-dimensional data.
- *Gradient Boosting & XGBoost*: Boosting algorithms that are known for their accuracy and performance in prediction tasks.

## Results

Each model's predictions are evaluated using metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and R². The best-performing model is selected based on its accuracy and ability to generalize to unseen data.
